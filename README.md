# django-react-shandis

My version of how 2 build really #$%@ software that works. 

Sorta.

## What does it do?
It's Django. What else does Django do? It has React, what does React do?

## Hmm...
Yes. Well to be more precise I wanted a small crud app to upload some videos to my S3. Turns out I could have used simple Javascript on a plain HTML page. But where is the fun in that?

## ...And?
Its super well documented. Every function, class, loop will have it's own [readme](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) (apart from the django stuff which is Pythonic sorcery)so I can teach myself to write tests. We'll have good tests if we know what the function does heh? amiright?

## Details to run on local?
Install Django in whatever way pleases your fancy, in any OS of your liking. If you don't know how I would suggest visiting the [Django website](https://www.djangoproject.com/). It has some of the best Docs of any software in this century. Reactjs is findable (if that's a word) on the [reactjs website](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). Your choice will usually depend on the length and type of [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) you have. I have a small 'stache so I just added the CDNs to my app. [Twirled-stache-horned-rim-glass-wearing-americano-drinking](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi19OLmgNHcAhUI0xoKHZMXCi0Qjhx6BAgBEAM&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.msg-life.com%2Fen%2Fyour-career%2Fjob-profiles%2Fsoftware-developer%2F&psig=AOvVaw20rVSuQqFAFGKKP0RdoNgB&ust=1533389934528748) folks will very likely use some boutique package installer only they know. The rest of you should just head on over to the [reactjs website](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). Anyone without a stache is a pleb.

## It doesn't work!
I am not you, nor your computer so I have no idea why it works on mine and not yours. Ever seen a response like this? I shall introduce you and everyone else who wants a solution. [DOCKER](https://www.docker.com) ~~beeyach~~ My friend! [DevOps](https://medium.com/@devfire/how-to-become-a-devops-engineer-in-six-months-or-less-366097df7737) people keep going on about it so I'll probably have to include Docker so no one says "It's not working on mine." We'll see how good of a mess I make out of that. Hehe, I'm already goggling with glee.

## What is S3?
Simple storage service. I have no idea what the 'S' or '3' is for though. See [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

## Django Rest?
REST API capability for Django. Much like the [WP-REST-API-V2](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) for wordpress. Let other apps access your data and expose it. '[#AshleyMadison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach)'

## Tests?
I can't write good tests yet. I would rather learn how to build a homemade lathe. I like lathes. Lathes like me. Off to the sunset we go.

## Where is the data stored?
On SQLite3. I was lazy to do anything with Mysql. In any case, I would use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) instead. [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) would be the last option.

## Virtual Env?
It's a python thing but Good Practice nonetheless. Wrap your project and its dependencies apart from the global stuff. Hmm, I still don't know whether to suggest but I will just because. [VIRTUALENVWRAPPER](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Use that. or not. But use that.
