# django-react-shandis

My version of how 2 build really #$%@ software that works. 

Sorta.

##What does it do?
It's Django. What else does Django do? It has React, what does React do?

##Hmm...
Yes. Well to be more precise I wanted a small crud app to upload some videos to my S3. Turns out I could have used simple Javascript on a plain HTML page. But where is the fun in that?

##...And?
Its super well documented. Every function, class, loop will have it's own readme (apart from the django stuff which is Pythonic sorcery)so I can teach myself to write tests. We'll have good tests if we know what the function does heh? amiright?

##Details to run on local?
Install Django in whatever way pleases your fancy, in any OS of your liking. If you don't know how I would suggest visiting the Django website. It has some of the best Docs of any software in this century. Reactjs is findable (if that's a word) on the react website. Your choice will usually depend on the length and type of Mustache you have. I have a small 'stache so I just added the CDNs to my app. Twirled-stache-horned-rim-glass-wearing-americano-drinking folks will very likely use some boutique package installer only they know. The rest of you should just head on over to the reactjs website. Anyone without a stache is a pleb.

##It doesn't work!
I am not you, nor your computer so I have no idea why it works on mine and not yours. Ever seen a response like this? I shall introduce you and everyone else who wants a solution. DOCKER beeyach! DevOps people keep going on about it so I'll probably have to include Docker so no one says "It's not working on mine." We'll see how good of a mess I make out of that. Hehe, I'm already goggling with glee.

##What is S3?
Simple storage service. I have no idea what the 'S' or '3' is for though.

##Django Rest?
REST API capability for Django. Much like the WP-REST-API-V2 for wordpress. Let other apps access your data and expose it. '#AshleyMadison'

##Tests?
I can't write good tests yet. I would rather learn how to build a homemade lathe. I like lathes. Lathes like me. Off to the sunset we go.

##Where is the data stored?
On SQLite3. I was lazy to do anything with Mysql. In any case, I would use Firebase instead. MySQL would be the last option.

##Virtual Env?
It's a python thing but Good Practice nonetheless. Wrap your project and its dependencies apart from the global stuff. Hmm, I still don't know whether to suggest but I will just because. [VIRTUALENVWRAPPER](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Use that. or not. But use that.
